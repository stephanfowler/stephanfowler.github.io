For Guardian HackDay, a system for crowdsourcing "related content". The idea is to promote the Guardian as first-port-of-call news destination by identifying quality journalism - through consensus - from across the news ecosystem. It could be syndicated to participating orgs, and could potentially pop-up on non-participating sites to drive traffic to related Guardia articles.
