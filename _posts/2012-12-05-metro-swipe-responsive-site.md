I built the front-end architecture for the [new **Metro** site][1]. It&#8217;s the first newspaper site that allows its readers to swipe through an edition of articles. On iPhone, iPad, and other supported devices, left/right touch gestures pull in articles from the current section context. On the desktop, the left/right keyboard keys do the same. The idea is to provide both an appealing newspaper-like reading experience and to significantly boost pages-per-visit. Articles have a single URL across all devices, which is also great for SEO. It has achieved this by being the first national UK newspaper site to embrace responsive design, as well as responsive content techniques: all image sizes, certain elements such as sidebars, and ads slots are sized or loaded conditionally according to device viewport width. The new site has delivered a significant and sustained increase to pages-per-visit and mobile traffic.
