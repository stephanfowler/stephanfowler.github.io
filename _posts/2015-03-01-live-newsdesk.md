My 3rd win (yes I bloweth mine own trumpet) of the Overall Best Hack at [Guardian Hack Day 2015](http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/live/2015/feb/26/guardian-hack-day-february-2015-liveblog) was a site component that is a representation of the paper's "live newsdesk", showing an animated up-to-the-minute stream of new and updated Guardian content.
