I built __[NFT Surface](https://github.com/stephanfowler/nft-surface)__, a white-label NFT platform to showcase, mint, sell, buy, and transfer NFTs. 

This was to get my hands dirty with the general dev stack for Ethereum, Solidity smart contracts, and web3 frontends. NFTs were an obvious example application; I got opinionated about them in the process and consequently wrote a couple of Medium articles about them: [NFTs and Authenticity](https://medium.com/coinmonks/nfts-and-authenticity-part-1-86cb7c0cb979), [NFT Best Practices](https://medium.com/@stephanfowler/nfts-and-permanence-part-2-40f44cdd8cb6).
