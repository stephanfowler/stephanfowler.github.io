The [**blogs site**][1] for Metro newspaper was an opportunity to try out a front-end architecture for swipe navigation through an &#8220;edition&#8221; of articles. I preload articles &#8211; sized according to the user&#8217;s device &#8211; on either side of the visible article, and enable touch-screen gestures to pull the next/previous article into view.

On a desktop computer, use the left/right keyboard keys instead to initiate a swipe.
