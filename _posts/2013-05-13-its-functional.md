Just completed [Functional Programming Principles in Scala][1] on [Coursera][2]. Martin Odersky is impressive, as are the ideas behind his language. Favourite moment: all primes as a lazy evaluated infinite recursive stream, via the the Sieve of Eratosthenes. To iterate is human, to recurse divine&#8230; etc. Also liked Coursera a lot. Combine the coursework with a meetup with other participants, and you get something very close to the experience of university study. Recommended.
