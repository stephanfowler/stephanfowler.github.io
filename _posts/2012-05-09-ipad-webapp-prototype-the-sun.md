News International wanted to explore other ways to get The Sun onto the iPad. I built them [a prototype iPad **webapp**][1] with swipe-through edition reading, a section-by-section progress-bar, and complete background downloading for offline reading. Note: this was a rapid prototype! It only works on iPad, is buuuggy, and is no longer connected to live data.
