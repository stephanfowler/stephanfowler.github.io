I became a Product Manager. For 3 years I had no time to write about being a Product Manager. But strangely, I did find time to develop [K Tang](http://ktang.love). It's the world's frst [Kimchi ketchup](http://kimchiketchup.com), possibly. A naturally fermented tangy sauce for brunch, eggs, avocado, cheese, fries, burgers, and everything else you used to put ketchup on. Before you discovered K Tang.
