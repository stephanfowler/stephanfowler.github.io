I became a Product Manager 3 years ago. For 3 years I had no time to write about being a Product Manager. But strangely, I recently found time to develop [K Tang](http://ktang.love).

It's the world's frst [Kimchi ketchup](http://kimchiketchup.com) (possibly). A naturally fermented tangy sauce for brunch, eggs, avocado, cheese, fries, burgers, and everything else you used to put ketchup on. Before you discovered K Tang.
