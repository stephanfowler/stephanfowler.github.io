Three years ago I became a Product Manager at the Guardian. Since then I had no time to write about it, or anything gelse. But strangely, I found time to develop [K&nbsp;Tang](http://ktang.love). 

It's the world's frst [Kimchi ketchup](http://kimchiketchup.com). Quite possibly. A naturally fermented tangy sauce for brunch, eggs, avocado, cheese, fries, burgers, and everything else you used to put ketchup on before you discovered K&nbsp;Tang.
