###Relatedness

Relatedness<sup>1</sup> is the claim that all that exists — every being — is in a foundational sense always interrelated and inseparable (Spinelli, 2015, p.16). This state or indeed <em class="ri">process</em> of relatedness preexists any attempted representation of it, making it somewhat problematic to convey linguistically. To assert that all “things” are connected already moves away from an authentic apprehension of the underlying condition and into an act of so-called “thing-ifying”, of dismantling the world according to a model of distinct components and linguistic forms (Spinelli, 2015, p.14–15). From a therapeutic perspective, the implication is that no real separation exists between observing subjects and observed objects. Our language is nevertheless construed to rely on this separation and thus to predispose us precisely towards it.
