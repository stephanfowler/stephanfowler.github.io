I&#8217;ve rebuilt the [**Chap&nbsp;Magazine**][1]&#8216;s site. It&#8217;s responsive. If you compare it on mobile, tablet, then desktop, you&#8217;ll notice increasing amounts of story teasers on home/section pages, as well as increasing (true) image sizes. 

It uses my [Responsive Content][2] jQuery plugin to achieve this. You can emulate the different device sizes &#8211; and see the resulting content that gets loaded &#8211; from your desktop browser by adding [#emulator][3] to the URL, then resizing your window.
