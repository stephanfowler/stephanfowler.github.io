The Guardian has an [in-house system called Ophan][1] that collects a vast stream of &#8220;attention data&#8221;, covering every page click and transition across the site. I build [a service][2] that returns these plotted in various cuts as small sparkline images. It&#8217;s built in NodeJs and is integrated into the [tools][3] I&#8217;ve been developing for editing the front and section pages of the [new Guardian site][4].
