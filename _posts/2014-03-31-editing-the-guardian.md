The front-page on Guardian&#8217;s [Beta site][1] is edited 24/7. So are its US and Australia editions plus a host of section and topic pages. I built the editor-facing tool that enables this. There&#8217;s a [write up at the Beta blog][2] about it and our thoughts about editorial strategy. The tool includes drag/drop insertion of Guardian content from anywhere (eg. the tool itself, The Guardian, Google, our internal analytics tool), rapid publication, individual page-view graphs split by referrer, and quick composition/launch of new pages or page-areas.
