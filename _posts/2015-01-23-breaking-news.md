My "breaking news" web alerts [hack](/2014/07/breaking-news/) is now in production on the new Guardian website. They appear as animated overlays at the bomttom of the screen.

Their value is illustrated by a traffic graph for an example article, promoted using an alert. The red area show referrals from the alert, which features on any page in the edition that is being targeted (UK, US, Australia, or global. The blue chunk is traffic referrals from the homepage.)
