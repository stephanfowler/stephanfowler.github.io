My "breaking news" web alerts [hack](/2014/07/breaking-news/) is now in production on the new Guardian website. They appear as animated overlays at the bomttom of the screen.

The value of this is visible in the traffic graph for the article that is promoted using an alert. The red area show referrals from the alert, which feature on any page in the edition (UK, US, Australia) targeted by it. The blue chunk is traffic referrals from the homepage.
