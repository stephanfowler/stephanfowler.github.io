There&#8217;s an emerging class of website that tries to behave as much as possible like an app &#8211; to the extent that a device&#8217;s capabilities enable it to. I think the label &#8220;siteapp&#8221; suits such websites. They&#8217;re sites that transform themselves into apps &#8211; if possible. 

The [new **Metro** site][1] feasibly falls under that label. Its app-like user experience on certain touch devices is an extension of it&#8217;s principal role &#8211; as a website. If the user&#8217;s device offers the necessary capabilities, it abandons the usual request/response page paradigm and becomes an app (i.e. it loads new &#8220;pages&#8221; via Ajax, updating the URL in the address bar as you navigate, all the while retaining a single page execution context).

This idea isn&#8217;t new. It&#8217;s just Progressive Enhancement taken to its conclusion. Yet it maybe warrants its own label, if only to differentiate it from what&#8217;s more widely understood by the term &#8220;webapp&#8221;. 

Even though the user on a fully featured mobile might not perceive a difference between the two, a webbapp (such as the [FT][2]&#8216;s) is conceived as a full-blown substitute for a native app; it comes from the other end of a spectrum. Yet you wouldn&#8217;t demand that a webapp honours canonical URLs; that&#8217;s a website&#8217;s job. A page on *ft.com* isn&#8217;t a page on *app.ft.com*, or vice versa. 

Whereas you absolutely *should* expect a siteapp to honour all URLs on all possible devices. Because before anything else, *it is the website*.

The distinction shouldn&#8217;t need to survive our eventual realisation that the term &#8220;website&#8221; is sufficient to cover anything that can be built with available web technologies. The whole HTML5 campaign is, of course, the huge leap towards that. In the meantime, let&#8217;s keep inventing bedazzling jargon for the same thing &#8211; the web. Just to show off its many faces.
